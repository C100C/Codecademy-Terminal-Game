# 🎯 20 Questions — Python Terminal Game

## 📝 Purpose

A simple terminal-based Python game based on the classic game **20 Questions** — where one player has 20 yes/no questions to guess a random object the other is thinking of.
The game gives the player 3 guesses to correctly guess the item. After 10 correct guesses or 3 fails, the game ends.

This project was primarily created for practice with **Git** and **VS Code**. Through it, I learned how to:
- Commit code using Git
- Pull updates from a remote repo
- Push code to GitHub using the terminal

This is a learning project; improvements like better input handling, logic, or a GUI may come later!

## How to play
Simply clone the repo and run the code! It is best if you do not look at the items list for the answers.

## Technology used
- Python
- Git & Github
- VS Code
